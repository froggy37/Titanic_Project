# Titanic_Project
Data analysis of titanic passenger csv data, using python.

A csv file containing data about the passengers aboard the titanic was analysed using a python notebook (ipython). Pandas dataframe and
and numpy arrays were used as well as matplotlib functions. 
The final python notebook was converted into an html file to display the final outcome. You can still look at the python code in the
ipython file though.
