# Titanic_Data_Analysis_Pandas
Data analysis of titanic passenger csv data, using Pandas python library.

A csv file containing data about the passengers aboard the titanic was analysed using a python notebook (ipython). Pandas dataframe and
and numpy arrays were used as well as matplotlib functions. 
The final python notebook was converted into an html file to display the final outcome. You can still look at the python code in the
ipython file though.

If you want to run the jupyter-notebook:

- Download jupyter-notebook:
  - pip install notebook
- Run:
  - jupyter-notebook titanic.ipynb
